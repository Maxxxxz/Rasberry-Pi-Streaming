# Raspberry Pi Streaming

I made this because I thought it would be interesting to host 
something on my Twitch channel instead of actually 
streaming.

This has only been tested on a Raspberry Pi 3B+, so I'm unsure
if previous models of the Pi could run this.

# Requirements
* FFmpeg installed
* x11grab working
